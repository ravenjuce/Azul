## Group Feedback
* I like the skeleton diagrams, which show that a lot of thought went into this design.
* Could you represent Tile color as an enum?
* Think about the common features of Factory and Center - could you use inheritance to represent this?
* It's not clear what the Status class is intended to represent.
* It's nice to see that you've copied the relevant parts of the rules into the Javadoc for each class - this will be helpful as you implement the code.
* It doesn't look like you've thought much about the GUI design yet - please start considering how the GUI will interact with the game logic.
* I was surprised to see the entire skeleton added in a single commit from Wangyi. I would have expected more intermediate commits as you worked through the skeleton together.

## Mark: **2.0/3**
