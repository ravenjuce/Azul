## Group Integration Feedback
* The game is looking really good! However, it would be good to implement automatic change of turn (so the player doesn't need to click the 'next player' button), and improve the 'click to select' function so it places the tiles in storage rather than on the floor.

#### Criteria for gaining 1 / 1

### Comments: 
* This is a very good description of Xuanchen's code, particularly what is good about it. However, the review is not actionable - there is nothing that Xuanchen can use to improve the code. For example, it's really not clear what rules 'clickInCenter' and 'clickInFactory' implement; these methods could benefit from more comprehensive Javadoc.

### Comments: 
* As per the comments for Zixin's review, this is a very good description of Wangyi's code, but it is not actionable. How can Wangyi improve her code - for example, is there any risk that `newX`, `newY` will remain null, and if so what happens in this case?
